        <li>Easy to add, remove, and search for information.</li>
        <li>High security features like <a href="https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-a-relational-database" target="_blank">relational database</a> prevent from inconsistent data as data in multiple tables is related and must be handled properly.</li>
